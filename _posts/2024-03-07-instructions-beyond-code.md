[Instructions Beyond Code] is an article I co-authored with an [LLM] for an
exhibition at National Chengchi University. My brief was to encourage students
to explore the new media of generative art and artificial intelligence. I made
it a collaboration and dialog with an AI on the topic of computers and art,
which I call a *prompt-performance*.

The article is shaped by the LLM's own insights and limitations, and borrows and
adapts many ideas from the sources listed at the end. The title comes from a
line in *[Form+Code]* by Casey Raes and Chandler McWilliams: "we define form as
visual and spatial structures; code is defined primarily as computer programs,
but we extend the definition to include instructions beyond computer code." The
five design strategies, *Repetition, Transformation, Parameterization,
Visualization,* and *Simulation* are lifted directly from their book.

The index of influences on generative art drawing a line from Cubism through
Serial Art all the way to [Demoscene] is greatly compressed. The list of
critical decisions for generative artists is a productive set of binary choices:

1. Pixels vs Paint: digital or traditional media
1. Screen vs Print: on a monitor or on paper
1. Geometry vs Gesture: mechanical or human
1. Long Form vs Short Form: random or curated
1. Static vs Kinetic: still or moving
1. Fixed vs Responsive: one size or many
1. Software vs Hardware: virtual or embodied
1. On-chain vs Off-chain: NFTs or bust

I chose work from seven artists that neatly illustrate some of these decisions:
[Aluan Wang], [Graphyni], [Hemilylan], [Jun Yang], [Lai Tsung-Yun], [Liu
Nai-Ting], and [Natalie.J]. Jun Yang's "fill-in-the-blanks" poster series for
the 2008 Taipei Biennial is a perfect example of a conceptual art as a set of
"instructions beyond code." It's a "generative artwork" that is only fully
realized by autonomous participants.

Yang's work was one of the catalysts of the contemporary independent art space
movement in Taiwan in the past decade and a half. Today Distributed Autonomous
Organizations are emerging as institutional alternatives for art production,
collection, and exhibition. A DAO for the Arts is not an answer but an
opening. So start generating your future!

My thanks to Huang Mu-Yi for commissioning the article and to [Newyellow] for
his translation.
