> It turns out that Elixir's popular MVC web framework doesn't need Models,
> Views, or even Controllers.

I've never been an adherent of the [MVC] pattern in web applications, even
though it has been a productive concept for full-featured server-side software.
I might use [Webmachine] or an equivalent program in Erlang, Ruby, or Clojure;
or I might not require an HTML template engine or a database wrapper.
I often prefer building up a web app piece by piece, instead of committing
up-front to an opinionated framework.

When working in Elixir, [Plug] suffices for the piecemeal approach.
Nevertheless, it is tempting to use [Phoenix Framework][Phoenix], which adds
many features without sacrificing flexibility or performance.

Although I can generate a Phoenix project without Models, or else encapsulate
them in a separate [OTP] application from my web app;
and although I can avoid Views by sending responses directly using Plug;
I didn't think I could escape from Phoenix's Controllers (without completely
replacing the Router).
Soon I would find a way.

## Spelling W-E-B with M-V-C

Model–View–Controller (MVC) is a software design pattern that developed out of
early (desktop) graphical user interfaces but was later adapted to describe web
application frameworks, such as [Ruby on Rails] and, more recently, [Phoenix].

For server-side web software, [MVC] denotes the components that manage data
(*Models*), media representations (*Views*), and HTTP request/response behavior
(*Controllers*).
Nevertheless, the MVC pattern does not name its central component, the
**Router**, which dispatches each request to the code that will handle the
response.

Take a basic request line such as:

```http
GET /some HTTP/1.1
```

In Phoenix, a `GET` request for `/some` resource is matched using a router
macro:

```elixir
get "/some", SomeController, :index
```

This `get` macro call is equivalent to:

```elixir
match :get, "/some", SomeController, :index
```

Here, the arguments comprise an HTTP verb, a URL path, a Controller, and an
action function.
These four terms together determine a "route" in Phoenix.
But do they have to?

## The Controller Pattern

The `match` macros in [Phoenix] Router are not limited to using a Phoenix
Controller.
Instead, the routes will accept any module that follows the [Plug]
specification.

```elixir
match :get, "/plug", SomePlug, []
```

So, if a Phoenix route does not require a Controller, does that mean we can drop
the last letter of **MVC**?

*Not necessarily.*

Because the role of the Router is often elided when we talk about Web MVC, it's
easy to miss its significance.
The Controller part of MVC is not just a `Controller` module that includes one
or more action functions.
Rather, it is a particular contract, enforced by the Router, for matching a
request with the code that will handle the response.
We have already seen this contract in the API for Phoenix's `match` macro:

```elixir
# Generates a route match based on an arbitrary HTTP method
match(verb, path, plug, plug_opts, options \\ [])
```

I argue that the real Controller pattern in Web MVC matches a **verb** and
**path**, and executes a **module/function** in the context of a **request**.

For most [CRUD] apps, the Controller pattern suffices.
But it does not work for resource designs such as:

1. An echo server that replies to all requests for a path (for any HTTP method)
1. A REST-based framework where the HTTP methods supported by each resource are
   encoded in the connected Plug, and not the Router; *e.g.*, [PlugRest]

## Breaking the Pattern

I brought up method-agnostic Phoenix routes again in [a closed issue][977] on
the GitHub project page.
After some discussion, [Chris McCord] offered that Phoenix already supports this
behavior by way of a catch-all verb:

```elixir
match :*, "/any", SomePlug, []
```

The feature exists for use with the `forward` macro, but had not been publicly
endorsed for use with `match`.
Fortunately, it seems this feature may be documented in the next release of
Phoenix.
This finally allows us to drop the Controllers from our "MVC" web app.

## Doing It Wrong?

I was curious about the initial reluctance to fully support a catch-all `match`
macro in Phoenix Router, and how it could be "abused" or "introduce bad
behaviors".
I have a hunch it stems from a decision in Rails to [deprecate "match"][5964]
without an explicit method (resolved in [this commit][56cdc81]).

Rails warns about the danger of unintentionally putting "state-changing" code
that manipulates resources on `GET`-accessible routes.
The [documentation][Rails match] advises that "You should not use the match
method in your router without specifying an HTTP method."
[Egor Homakov][Match in Rails and CSRF] is even more blunt, writing:

> You always know which HTTP Verb is used for specific "controller#action"! **If
> you don't - you are doing it wrong.**

This assumes, of course, that we are using the Controller pattern.
This may be a fair assumption for Rails, but it shouldn't be for Phoenix.

It's still possible to match all HTTP methods in a Rails route using an explicit
`via: :all` option.
Fortunately, Phoenix offers us the same escape hatch.

## Game, Set, Match

Phoenix's flexibility and openness to multiple, co-existing patterns for
structuring web applications is just one more thing to recommend the framework.

*Phoenix is only MVC if you want it to be.*
