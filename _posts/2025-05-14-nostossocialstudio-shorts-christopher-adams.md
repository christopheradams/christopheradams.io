> Finally, as we are coming out of Taipei Dangdai Art & Ideas this week I want
> to share a couple projects by friends locally in Taipei. The first is "Island
> of Another Scene," a stunning small-scale solo exhibition by Christopher
> Adams, which I somehow knew nothing about until it opened. I was blown away by
> the work and by its framing: Christopher presents some dozen portraits of
> artists, sometimes their faces, sometimes their work, sometimes a combination
> of the artist in the work.

> In the introduction to the project he talks about how the idea of relational
> aesthetics changed our understanding of what art is, and how the relationships
> that constitute art and its audience become a part of how we see the art. You
> could call it a practice of relational portraiture.
