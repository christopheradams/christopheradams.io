[Taipei Dangdai Art & Ideas][Taipei Dangdai] is the leading arts and culture
event in Taipei. The 2022 edition of the art fair welcomed four digital art
platforms, featuring work by [Ben Snell] for Art Blocks, [Huang Hai-Hsin] for SOYL,
[Rachel Rose] for Outland, and [Whistlegraph] for Feral File.

I designed the [Launch Stage] program for Taipei Dangdai, a real-time system
that interfaces with the blockchain to present the artists' NFTs as they were
minted. We invited the artists to call in over video chat to address a live
audience as their collections were released.
