[Taipei Dangdai Art & Ideas][Taipei Dangdai] is the leading arts and culture
event in Taipei. The 2022 edition of the art fair welcomed four digital art
platforms, featuring work by [Ben Snell] for Art Blocks, [Huang Hai-Hsin] for SOYL,
[Rachel Rose] for Outland, and [Whistlegraph] for Feral File.

For the program I designed **Launch Stage**, a real-time system that interfaces
with the Ethereum blockchain to present NFTs as they are minted. We invited the
participating artists to call in over video chat with a live audience as their
collections were released.
