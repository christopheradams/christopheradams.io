**Slopism** (*n*). An artistic movement in the early 21st Century characterized by the
depiction of latent spaces as paranaturalistic forms. (*adj.* **Slopist**)
{: .lead}

*Slopism* is a contemporary digital media art form based on generative
artificial intelligence that emerged in the late 2010s and early 2020s. The term
is derived from the colloquial phrase "AI slop," a pejorative label for
mass-produced, low-effort, and conceptually thin synthetic imagery, analogous to
"spam" in messaging systems. *Slopist* artworks render the *latent space* of an
AI model following the artist's training and prompts, while accentuating
*paranaturalistic* forms (anatomical or physical impossibilities, unstable
perspectives, erratic narratives, chimeras, and hallucinations) that expose the
model as a simulacrum rather than a reflection of reality.
