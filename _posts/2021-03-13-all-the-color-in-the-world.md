Jun Yang's *The Artist, his Collaborators, their Exhibition, and three
Venues* opened at **TKG+**, the **Kuandu Museum of Fine Arts**, and
**MoCA Taipei** between December 2020 and March 2021.

This series of exhibitions exploring fundamental questions of artistic
endeavor began at [Art Sonje] in 2018, and was enlarged at [Kunsthaus
Graz] in 2019 in collaboration with Barbara Steiner. It brought together
work by Bruce Yonemoto, Erwin Bauer, Koki Tanaka, Lee Kit, Maja Vukoje,
Michikazu Matsune, Mike Kelley, Oliver Klimpel, Paul McCarthy, siren eun
youn jung, Yuki Okumura, and Yuuki Nishimura, and Jun Yang.

The three Taipei venues were a commercial gallery, a national arts
university, and a contemporary art museum. These institutions presented
the work in various ways: as a solo show, a group exhibition, a
biennial, a retrospective, an open forum.

Jun and I created a project at MoCA Taipei titled [All the Color in the
World]: a set of posters displayed in the museum shop, a collection
listed on [OpenSea], and a public talk. We traced a path through art
history from one-offs, prints, copies, ready-mades, and now non-fungible
tokens. The poster series advertised the economics of an Ethereum smart
contract with one unique token per CMYK color. The actual NFT collection
minted the designs as abstract art on an open marketplace.

We'd only do this for *All the Color in the World*.
