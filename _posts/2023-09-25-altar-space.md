ALTAR SPACE is the genesis of Yao Jui-Chung's journey into "crypto art."  Three
original works, *Moon--Block--Chain*, *YAO COIN*, and *Twelve Disciples*
approach the new media of blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs through the
old means of divination tools, Buddhist coin charms, and religious icons. *The
past is rich with the technology for a future mythos.*

*[Yao Jui-Chung: Invidia]* was curated by Zian Chen and installed at Tina Keng
Gallery (Taipei) from 5 August to 23 September, 2023. This solo exhibition
brought together some 90 artworks from the past 25 years by Taiwanese artist
[Yao Jui-Chung] that blend history, legend, fantasy, life, and politics. Many of
the works produced during Yao's artist residencies overseas are assimilations of
cultural encounters and personal experiences. *Invidia* is both a retrospective
for the artist and a vision of where the world is taking him.

<!-- The title of the exhibition is from the Latin term for the deadly sin of -->
<!-- *[Envy]*. (Incidentally, the technology company [Nvidia] got its name from the -->
<!-- same word.) -->

Yao Jui-Chung is a multidisciplinary artist. His video and performance art
tackles historical and political subjects; his black-and-white and instant film
photography exposes peculiar religious sites and abandoned military bases; and
he has published scores of art books and catalogs over decades. Yao is also a
painter of "new ink art" that deconstructs the traditional medium.

Yao revitalizes Chinese landscape painting by eschewing ink wash and fine rice
paper in favor of color pens, gold leaf, and rough cotton paper (or
alternatively screen printing). An innovation in materials is mated with diverse
motifs. These works are conversant with vernacular culture, pop culture, and
subculture; world religion, folk religion, and new age spiritualism; plus
science fiction, mobile computing, and social media. Yao borrows compositions
from classical paintings as well as from images he finds on the Internet. The
totality is vulgar and sublime in equal measure.

Crypto art is a new medium for Yao, but he gives it a familiar framing. He reads
cryptocurrency as a prosperity theology, and blockchain transactions as the
liturgy. He recognizes collectible avatars as idols of worship, and crypto
tokens as the coin of the realm. He ponders the creation of a crypto wallet, the
prerequisite of any NFT art, and makes a ritual out of it. Yao has given the
name *Altar Space* to the site of his initiation.

*Altar Space* admits the polarity of spirituality and technology and the strata
of high- and low-culture. An annex room in the gallery transforms into a
*[cella]* devoted to crypto art. Yao visits a temple and generates a
cryptocurrency wallet using traditional divination tools; he prints his own coin
charm and mints a digital token; and he deploys a new pantheon of crypto
gods. Every technological innovation is the successor of a specific cultural
practice.

## Moon–Block–Chain

*Moon–Block–Chain* (2023) is a two-channel video shot at Hongludi Temple, a
popular place of worship where believers come at all hours of the night to judge
their fortunes. The videos open with a prayer to the [Righteous God of Blessing
and Virtue], pleading for the private key to an NFT wallet. The first video is
fixed on the artist, who stands in the main hall of the temple dressed all in
black save for a yellow puffer vest that matches his gilded surroundings. He
prays and repeatedly casts a pair of moon blocks on the ground, while other
(mostly young, masked) temple-goers carry on around him. The second video is a
series of still photographs of a pair of moon blocks on the temple floor,
showing the "answers" to his appeals.

[Moon blocks] are (usually) red-colored, crescent-shaped, wooden divination
tools that are commonplace at temples in Taiwan, especially in proximity to a
God of Prosperity or an Earth Deity. They are used to seek divine guidance in
the form of *yes or no* questions, often about careers, relationships, or
financial decisions. If you have a quandary, pick up two moon blocks, hold them
in prayer, recite your name, ask the question, and drop the blocks on the
ground. Each block has a round side and a flat side. If the two blocks land
opposite sides up, it means "yes," and otherwise it means "no." Three "yeses" in
a row indicate a successful reply to your query.

Answering Yao's prayer for a cryptocurrency wallet requires more than three
tosses. It needs *one-hundred and twenty-eight*, to be safe. Like flipping a
coin, the outcome of tossing moon blocks is random. And like *heads or tails*,
the *yes or no* answers from moon blocks can be read as a sequence of *ones* and
*zeroes*. A binary number that is big enough and entirely random can make for a
*secure* private key for a wallet, which is used to generate a public address
and to sign transactions on the blockchain. The steps for using moon blocks as a
source of *entropy* are detailed in an accompanying [divination guide].

Favorable divination and asymmetric cryptography both rely on an unpredictable
universe outside of your control. This is where faith and science each stake
their claim. You could call it fate, or just physics. The means are random but
the ends are constant. Praying for wealth is not so removed from playing the
odds.

To redeem his communion with the divine, Yao minted two collections on Ethereum
as **[Moon–Block–Chain: Prayers]** and **[Moon–Block–Chain: Answers]**. These
*sixty-four* videos and *sixty-four* photos are enduring specimens of
performance art and valuable documentation of a timeless custom. Each bit of the
prayers and answers is transmuted into a *non-fungible token* (NFT), a link in
the chain from supplication to indulgence and dispensation.

Open a cryptocurrency wallet, check the balance, and hope all those holdings go
"to the moon." This could be the answer to your prayers.

## YAO COIN

*YAO COIN* (2023) is a mixed media artwork made of a stack of gold-colored paper
coin charms imprinted with the artist's monogram, a pair of red moon blocks, and
an antique wood carving. At the *Invidia* exhibition, gallery visitors were
encouraged to take a coin in exchange for a cash donation. Small monetary
offerings like this are customary at temples.

*YAO COIN* (2023) is a [numismatic charm], a decorative coin that has
ritualistic uses in many Eastern religions. They are not fiat money but
circulate in unofficial economies. These days it's a rite of passage of every
cryptocurrency enthusiast to mint their own coin. Yao created two stop-motion
animations of his charms and deployed them on Tezos as **[YAO COIN: SPIN]** and
**[YAO COIN: STACKS]**. They are reminiscent of the golden Bitcoins that show up
as talismans of crypto art, with Yao's emblem taking the place of the currency
symbol. Part of the artist's spiritual and monetary worth is deposited in these
tradable tokens.

These editions of *YAO COIN* were limited to 1000 copies. They were not for
sale, but must be offered. The exchange values of the real and the virtual are
separate but equivalent. Lucky wallets could benefit from having a *YAO COIN* in
them.

## Twelve Disciples

*Twelve Disciples* (2023) is a series of colorful avatars in vintage frames,
arranged like religious icons from a strange theology. Yao drew from the
extensive roster of figures and animals that populate his paintings to imagine a
new hierarchy of beings in twelve echelons: *Aliens, Gods, Saints, Immortals,
A.I., Mutants, Humans, Fairies, Demons, Ghosts, Beasts,* and *Legendary
Creatures*. These portrayals mimic PFP (profile-picture) projects that have
become popular NFT collections.

Yao Jui-Chung, *Twelve Disciples* (2023)
{: .text-center}

Each tier in Yao's order of beings is occupied by a singular character. The
*Alien* has three pairs of legs stomping on its head, which stand for the world
religions that will "lose their footing" if extraterrestrials make first
contact. The *Saint* is a Bodhisattva who uses a laptop to monitor the world's
suffering. The *Mutant* is a demon of death and desire from Buddhist cosmology
who rips open its outer layer to reveal an angry mien within. The *Human* is a
golden baby with a third eye. The *Beast* is a feline astronaut, since the
artist imagines that the afterlife of our pets is somewhere in outer space. The
*Legendary Creature* is a nine-eyed dragon from Chinese mythology. The other
figures have equally curious stories.

For the **[Twelve Disciples 十二使徒]** collection on Tezos, Yao photographed
the finished artworks in a studio setting and in the gallery to create twin
"Light" and "Night" series. Each frame is as distinctive as the portrait it
holds, but a change in lighting turns one artwork into two. The works are hung
in the gallery as unique "art objects," but are published as NFTs in multiple
editions. There is a paradox of the unity of God and the multiplicity of "His"
depictions. Every shrine and niche in a temple is filled with the same Deities
in different guises. If you identify as a *CryptoPunk* or a *Bored Ape* or one
of the *Twelve Disciples*, you've found a new religion.

In so far as cryptocurrency culture and NFT art appear esoteric, tawdry, and
kitsch to non-adherents, they are a perfect fit for Yao Jui-Chung's
proclivities. You cannot dismiss them any more than you can scoff at the
everyday goings-on at a temple in Taiwan. They are the same practice for a
different holy spirit. *An eternal skeptic and cynic like Yao can still have
trust in the market and belief in the divine, when the temptation is there.*
