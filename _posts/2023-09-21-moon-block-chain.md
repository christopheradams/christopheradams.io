One late winter night, the artist [Yao Jui-Chung] ascended the hundreds of steps
leading up to Hongludi Temple in the mountains above Taipei. After arriving in
the main hall, he set down his camera, picked up a pair of red wooden [moon
blocks], and recited this prayer:

> Disciple Yao Jui-Chung has come to ask the God of Blessing and Virtue
> for the password for an NFT wallet. Thank you for giving me this
> password. I wish for world peace and good fortune for all. Thank you
> God of Blessing and Virtue, your disciple bows before you.

Seeking guidance by divination is a long-standing custom, but asking the Deities
for a cryptocurrency wallet is something of an innovation. Tossing the moon
blocks on the ground and interpreting their yes--no answer as a *one* or a
*zero* gives Yao the first bit of information he needs. He would have to perform
this ritual 128 times in total to compose a sufficiently long random number for
his secure private key. Only Yao and the Gods know what it is.

To make good on his plea for a lucky wallet, Yao minted two collections of
videos and photos on Ethereum as **[Moon--Block--Chain: Prayers]** and
**[Moon--Block--Chain: Answers]**. Each of the sixty-four *Prayers* is a unique
five-second video loop (with sound) of the artist tossing moon blocks in the
temple hall. Each of the sixty-four *Answers* is a unique still photograph of
the pair of blocks on the temple floor, with an attribute that identifies them
as *angry, laughing,* or *divine.*

<!-- Before you ask: this is a *performance*. You won't figure out Yao's private key -->
<!-- from these collections. -->

Yao Jui-Chung. *Moon--Block--Chain: Prayer #4* (2023)
{: .text-center}

This work approaches crypto-art from first principles. Creating a wallet becomes
a devout act that is charged with meaning. Both favorable divination and
asymmetric cryptography derive their power from the riddle of an infinite and
random universe. Praying for fortune and speculating on currencies are two sides
of the same coin. The esoteric rituals and garish art of folk religion find
their match in the cryptic software and vulgar memes of blockchain
culture. Yao's *Prayers* and *Answers* take their perfect form when transmuted
into individual tokens in a blessed smart contract. The artist is no stranger to
seeking divine guidance (or putting his body on the line) for the sake of his
art.

Yao Jui-Chung's *Moon--Block--Chain* (2023) is the latest entry in his catalog
of photo and video performance artworks made over the past three decades. It
also follows his careful study and documentation of Buddhist and Taoist
religious sites. A two-channel video of the new work was installed as part of
[Altar Space]({% post_url 2023-09-25-altar-space %}) in the exhibition *[Yao
Jui-Chung: Invidia]* at Tina Keng Gallery in August 2023.
