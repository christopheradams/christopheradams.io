*Centering Disaster* is a series of experiments with a technique called
"outpainting," where an AI extends an image by merging its visual features
with a new prompt. In the center lies an ominous black whale, surrounded by a
collapsing civilization or ecosystem. Here, context is everything.

The image of a black whale in the Piazza San Marco came from a prompt by Ai Lao
and Jon Phillips: "Venice, What's Underwater?" The whale could be interpreted as
a decadent art object, or something more sinister. I came around to thinking
about the prompt literally: Venice is underwater! Or it soon will be.

Venice is sinking while the seas are rising. The Biennale comes every two years,
a major flood every 50. The city's wooden piles that pierce the lagoon are met
by the meltwaters of ice sheets and glaciers. By 2100, Venice could well be
underwater.

AI art has a similar dilemma of "ecological ethics" as the land art movement (think Robert Smithson or Michael Heizer), which necessarily altered the environment, often using heavy machinery. In the same way, AI depends upon the lithium mining *and* data mining, and must situate itself within environmental and social disruptions.

(As an aside, one of the earliest instances of land art took place at the 1968 Venice Biennale, when Nicolás García Uriburu dyed the Grand Canal green.)
