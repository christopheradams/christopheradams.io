*Any Warhol Bags* is part of an ongoing series querying the hierarchy of
classifications embedded in AI tools, in dialog with influences of contemporary
art. These pictures were machine-generated with an initial image of one of Andy
Warhol's *Camouflage Self-Portrait*.

Linked to the series [Any Warhol, Animal, Vegetable, Mineral]({% link
_posts/2022-12-01-any-warhol-animal-vegetable-mineral.md %}), which audits the
general taxonomies underpinning AI tools, this series examines the
representation of materials by the diffusion models through the lens of
portraiture. Each plastic bag portrait is unique and yet recognizably the same.
