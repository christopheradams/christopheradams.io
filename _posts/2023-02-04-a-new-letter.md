A turn away from social media means more time to pour into personal writing that
goes out by email and web feeds. I started making websites in the 1990s, and
maintained a blog using [Textpattern] from 2008 to 2012 before abandoning it in
favor of photography.

If I had to pinpoint what got me to start blogging again, it wasn't simply the
allure of [static site generators] that it did. It was Emacs, specifically [Org
mode], which I started using in 2015, and in which I've since typed some 700,000
words. Org mode is *made* for writing, anything from note-keeping, to document
editing, project planning, and even [literate programming]. The tagline says it
all: **Your life in plain text.**

While Org mode handles to-do lists, agendas, spreadsheets, time tracking, and
more, at its root it's a kind of word processor called an [outliner], which has
[a deep role in software history], particularly the web, blogging, and RSS.

Org mode doesn't *make* me want to write, but it *keeps* me writing, if that
makes any sense. All day I'm keeping a diary, taking notes, saving bookmarks,
making to-do lists, all the while touching text. It feels natural to take the
next step to edit, format, and publish it.

I created this category of posts to collect observations, personal news, and
links that I might otherwise throw over the transom to a social media company,
and instead keep them here at home, and send them out for you to read.

This first post serves as a notice that it's working, and the next one is
coming.
