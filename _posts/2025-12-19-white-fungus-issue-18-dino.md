A number of my portraits of **Dino**, a pioneering Taiwanese noise artist who
passed away in 2022, taken over the decade that I knew him, appear in the latest
issue of the arts magazine *White Fungus*, in an article "Infinite Feedback: A
Toast to Resting in the Highest Excellence" by Yan Jun.

Issue 18 of *White Fungus* can be pre-ordered at
