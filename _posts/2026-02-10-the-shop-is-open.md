I've now opened a digital gallery as a direct source for collectors to acquire
*one-of-a-kind* works at **[shop.christopheradams.io]**.

The first set of photographs listed for sale are among those exhibited at my
solo show *[Island of Another Scene]* (May--August 2025, Taipei), where I was
guided by The Studio's Cesar Reyes and Jessica Lin to put a price on my
images. The new shop will host these works and make others available in the
future.

The business of selling photographs involves a complex calculus of edition
sizes, paper stock, framing materials, and shipping costs. I've simplified the
equation by offering only a *single* edition of each work as an archival inkjet
print and digital image file.

I gleaned the spirit and mechanics of making works unique from the practice of
German photographer [Wolfgang Tillmans], who is known for presenting his
photographs as large-format unframed prints. His collectible works are sold as
an edition of one, plus one artist proof, and are accompanied by a signed
certificate of authenticity, a small color match print, and a CD that stores the
high-resolution image. The artist is bound by the same rule as the collector: to
retain only a single exhibition copy of the work; the print may even be
destroyed and re-created as needs and technologies change.[^Marchesi2021] This
pact between the _image-maker_ and *image-owner* sustains the work's value,
while the color print and digital file conserve its qualities.

I have adapted Tillmans's practice by dropping the compact disc but adding a
cryptographic signature file to verify the digital image. You may well ask, *why
not use a blockchain for this?* I'm aware that [NFTs] can resolve a connection
between contract, ownership, data, and image.

~~However, I desire an approach that begins with an *image* and then forms a
*relationship.*~~

In short, these works are more than *tokens.*

An initial set of ten works are now listed in the digital gallery. Additional
works from **[the Collection]** are available for production upon
request. Please email <shop@christopheradams.io> for any inquiries.
