I've now opened a digital gallery at **[shop.christopheradams.io]**. This is a
direct source for collectors to acquire unique editions of my work.

Many of the photographs listed for sale were first exhibited at my solo show
*[Island of Another Scene]* (May--August 2025, Taipei), where I was guided by
The Studio's Cesar Reyes and Jessica Lin to put a price on my images. The
digital gallery will make these and other works available going forward.

The business of selling photographs usually involves a complex calculus of
edition sizes, print dimensions, paper stock, framing materials, inventory
management, and shipping costs. I've simplified the equation by offering only a
*single* edition of each work.

I gleaned the spirit and mechanics of treating an artwork as unique from the
practice of German photographer [Wolfgang Tillmans]. His photographs are
customarily presented as large-format unframed prints, while a unique
collectible work is constellated as a signed certificate of authenticity, a
small inkjet print, and a CD containing a high-resolution image.[^Marchesi2021]
The collector is instructed to make and retain only a single print of the work
at a time, while the artist is bound by the same rule. This pact between the
*image-maker* and *image-owner* sustains the work's value, while the color match
print and digital file conserve its qualities.

Authenticity --img class="img-thumbnail" %}

I have adapted Tillmans's practice by dropping the compact disc but adding a
cryptographic signature file to verify the digital image. You may well ask, *why
not use a blockchain for this?* I'm well aware that [NFTs] can solve the
connection between contract, ownership, data, and image. However, I desire an
approach that begins with an *image* and then forms a *relationship.* In short,
these works are no *tokens.*

An initial set of ten works are now listed in the digital gallery. Additional
works from **[the Collection]** are available for production upon
request. Please email <shop@christopheradams.io> for any inquiries.
