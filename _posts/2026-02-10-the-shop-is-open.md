I've now opened a digital photography gallery at
**[shop.christopheradams.io]**. This is a direct source for collectors to
acquire one-of-a-kind editions of my work.

I had never sold in a gallery prior to my solo show *[Island of Another Scene]*
(May--August 2025, Taipei), but I was guided by The Studio's Cesar Reyes and
Jessica Lin to put a price on my images. The digital gallery will now make these
and other works available going forward. The business of selling photographs
usually involves a complex calculus of edition sizes, print dimensions, paper
stock, framing materials, inventory management, and shipping costs. I've
simplified the equation by only offering a single edition of each work.

I gleaned the spirit of treating each artwork as unique from the practice of
German photographer [Wolfgang Tillmans]. His photographs are customarily
presented as large-format unframed prints, while a collected work is accompanied
by a signed certificate of authenticity, a small inkjet print, and a CD
containing a high-resolution image.[^Marchesi2021] The collector is instructed
to make a single print of the work for display or exhibition, while the artist
is bound by the same constraint. This crafts a compact between the two
image-owners that respects the intrinsic value of the work.

Authenticity --img class="img-thumbnail" %}

I adapted this practice to my own toolset by packaging each work with a [PGP]
digital signature file, and entrusting modern file storage rather than a compact
disc. Collectors will receive the physical materials in the mail.

An initial set of ten works are now listed in the digital gallery. Additional
works from the [Collection] are available upon request. Please email
<shop@christopheradams.io> for any inquiries.
