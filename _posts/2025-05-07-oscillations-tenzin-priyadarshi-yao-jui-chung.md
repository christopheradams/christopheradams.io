I curated an exhibition for two photographers whom I am fortunate to count as
mentors and friends. [Yao Jui-Chung] is an artist from Taiwan, and my
collaborator on the *[Altar Space]* project. [Tenzin Priyadarshi] is a monk from
India, and my instructor for the "Principles of Awareness" class with [Joi
Ito]. After I introduced Yao and Venerable Tenzin in Taipei a couple of years
ago, showing their work together was an inevitability.

HOHOBase gallery, on the Northeast coast of Taiwan, is perched above an old
railroad track that bisects the Shen'ao mountain and beach, with a view of the
sea. It's a perfect spot for the meeting of these two visionaries.

HOHObase is proud to present *Oscillations*, bringing together the work of
Venerable Tenzin Priyadarshi Rinpoche and Yao Jui-Chung for the very first
time. The exhibition comprises thirty-five photographs from the artists'
long-term spiritual and pictorial inquiries that traverse our living world and
our inner nature.

Venerable Tenzin's work encompasses portrait, landscape, still life, and nature
photography from around the world. Over 100 of his colorful "photographic
essays" captured in fifteen countries are collected in *Solivagant* (Prajnopaya
Institute, 2024). The title is from the Latin, "one who wanders alone," and the
images reveal this essence of solitude in movement.

Yao has documented around 700 gigantic statues of gods across Taiwan on
black-and-white film. This series produced two books, *Incarnation* (ARTouch,
2017), and *Incarnation Plus* (ARTouch, 2023), and won the Taishin Arts Award
in 2018. The English title refers to the embodiment of our self-image in these
deities, while the Chinese title (literally, 'Giant God Connection') conceives
of them as an island-wide spiritual network.

An *oscillation* is a repeated variation between two or more different states
(like a swinging pendulum, a plucked string, a beating heart, or an
electromagnetic wave), and is made manifest in the Buddhist concepts of
dependent origination, cyclic change, and impermanence. Venerable Tenzin travels
the globe and photographs spontaneously while embarking on an immeasurable and
contemplative inward journey. Yao methodically picks each local site and vantage
point to photograph these giant statues, which hear our prayers while the cracks
start to show.

The contrast between these photographs by Venerable Tenzin and Yao Jui-Chung
expose a shared understanding. As dedicated practitioners of Buddhism and
photography, their divergent paths have brought them, momentarily, to the very
same place.

*An opening ceremony for Oscillations will be held at HOHObase on Wednesday, May 14, 2025 at 2:30pm with the Venerable Tenzin Priyadarshi Rinpoche and Yao Jui-Chung in attendance. We kindly welcome you to visit.*
