Saravuth Inn is originally from Cambodia. You can often find him playing chess
in Union Square. The man is a scholar but has had a very trying life, and was the
subject of a documentary titled *Odysseus' Gambit*. We shared a smoke and a game
and he beat me handily, but let me make a portrait in return.
