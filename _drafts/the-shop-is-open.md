I've now opened a digital gallery as a direct source for collectors to acquire
*one-of-a-kind* works at [shop.christopheradams.io].

The first set of photographs listed for sale are among those exhibited at my
solo show *[Island of Another Scene]* (May--August 2025, Taipei), where I was
guided by The Studio's Cesar Reyes and Jessica Lin to put a price on my
images. The new shop will host these works and make others available in the
future.

The business of selling photographs involves a complex calculus of edition
sizes, paper stock, framing materials, and logistics costs. I've simplified the
equation by offering just *one* edition of each work in a physical and digital
format.

I gleaned the spirit and mechanics of making works unique from the practice of
German photographer [Wolfgang Tillmans]. He customarily exhibits his photographs
as large-format unframed prints, while collectible works are sold as an edition
of one, plus one artist's proof, accompanied by a signed certificate of
authenticity, a small inkjet print, and a CD that stores the high-resolution
image. The artist is bound by the same directive as the collector: to retain a
*single* exhibition copy of the work. The print may even be destroyed and
re-created as circumstances and technologies change.[^Marchesi2021] This pact
between the *image-maker* and *image-owner* sustains the work's value, while the
color print and digital file conserve its quality.

I've adapted Tillmans's practice by first discarding the compact disc, and then
signing the photograph cryptographically.[^nfts] Each work includes a digital
image and signature file, a certificate of authenticity, and an 8×10 archival
color match print.

An initial set of ten works are listed in the digital gallery. Additional works
from **[the Collection]** are available for production upon request. Please
email <shop@christopheradams.io> for any inquiries.

[^nfts]: You might ask, *why not use a blockchain for this?* An [NFT] contract
    *can* correlate a work's ownership, data, and image. However, I'm following
    an an older convention, where the artist--collector bond is much more than
    an entry in a distributed ledger. In short, these works are not just
    *tokens.*
