I've now opened a digital gallery as a direct source for collectors to acquire
*one-of-a-kind* works at [shop.christopheradams.io].

The first set of photographs for sale are among those exhibited at my solo show
*[Island of Another Scene]* (May--August 2025, Taipei), where I was nudged by
The Studio's Cesar Reyes and Jessica Lin to put a price on my images. The new
shop will host these works and make more available in the future.

The business of selling photographs is a commercial calculus of edition sizes,
paper stock, framing materials, and logistics costs. I've simplified the
equation by producing just *one* edition of each work in a physical and digital
format.

I gleaned the spirit and mechanics of making works unique from the practice of
German photographer [Wolfgang Tillmans]. He customarily exhibits his photographs
as unframed prints, while collectible works are sold as an edition of one (plus
one artist's proof), accompanied by a signed certificate of authenticity, a
small color print, and a CD that stores the high-resolution image.  The
collector agrees to retain a *single* exhibition print of the work, while the
artist is also free to make and exhibit one copy.  A print may even be destroyed
and re-produced as circumstances and technologies change.[^Marchesi2021] This
pact between the *image-maker* and *image-owner* sustains the work's value,
while the color match print and digital image file conserve its quality.

I've adapted Tillmans's practice by first discarding the compact disc, and then
signing the photograph cryptographically.[^nfts] Each work includes a digital
image and signature file, a certificate of authenticity, and an 8×10 archival
inkjet print.

An initial set of ten works are listed in the digital gallery. Additional works
from **[the Collection]** are available for production upon request. Please
email <shop@christopheradams.io> for any inquiries.

[^nfts]: You might ask, *why not use a blockchain for this?* An [NFT] *can*
    correlate a work's ownership, data, and image. However, I'm observing an
    older convention, where the artist--collector bond is more privy than a
    smart contract, and the images aren't broadcast to every odd marketplace. In
    short, these works are not just *tokens.*
