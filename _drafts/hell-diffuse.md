*Hell Diffuse* is a series of AI-generated imagery that synthesizes religion and
technology. But the picture is complicated. The tech looks obsolete while the
divine looks to the future. Eschatology studies the end times and final events
in world history and human destiny. It could be [Maitreya] or the [technological
singularity]. Either that or we're stuck in hell on earth.

What does an artificial intelligence imagine in a shrine? In the afterlife or
purgatory? It conjures boddhisattvas and demons using laptops. It hallucinates
nuclear weapons and space vehicles, UFOs and CRTs, robots and monsters. It
envisions deities with virtual reality headsets and immolated figures in smoke
and fire. The future Buddha sits in an empty lot with a dilapidated globe.

This AI was fine-tuned on Yao Jui-Chung's instant film and flash photography of
Buddhist and Taoist religious art, including depictions of heaven and
hell. These images have one pole floating in the fantasy world and another
grounded in photo-realism. As temples are already sites of artifice, the image
generation model can be absolved of its errors.
